# Visualization of an Artificial Neural Network
> Visual representantion of an artificial neural network as it learns, made with JavaScript.

## Overview of the project
This project is an expansion of a school assignment I worked on my last semester at university (Tec MM Campus Zapopan) with profesor José Antonio Aviña Méndez.
In this new version, I implement the algorithm in JavaScript and illustrate it using the P5.JS library. 

### What is a neural network?
A neural network comes from the field of study of the brain and how it learns. The brain has tons of neurons and these neurons have connections to other neurons. And these connections get fired up depending on the situation.

One could say that the brain learns by trial and error. For instance, you present a three year old with a letter and ask him what letter it is. He guesses wrong, so you tell him what the correct letter was.
You repeat this many times, with different letters and suddenly he starts to pick up on which letter each one is. 
The try that with one to three-syllable words and the kid will start to guess right the pronunciation of these.

### How does an artificial neural network works?
An artificial neural network (ANN) has the following parts:
- A minimum of three layers:
    - Input
    - Hidden
    - Output
- Weights between each layer
- Bias for each 

All layers have a number of neurons.

The input layer is the information that is being fed.

The hidden layer is the result of the input * the weight that connects to the next neuron + the bias, all these passed through an activation function.

And the output layer, is the same as the last layer. Except that in this instance, its hidden output * the weight that connects to the next neuron + the bias, all these passed through the same activation function.
### Training
#### Feed forward
#### Check the error
#### Back propagation
